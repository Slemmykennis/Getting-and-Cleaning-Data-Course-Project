# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
To achieve this goal, the following was done:
The source data set was obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
The R Script run_analyis.R was created to do the following:
•	Read data
•	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
•	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
•	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
•	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
•	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
•	Write the data set to tidy_data.txt file
